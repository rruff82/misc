I wanted to share it because I think it's simultaneously an interesting story and potentially useful script.  My hope is to provide a gentle introduction to Application Programming Interfaces (or APIs): what they are, how to use them, and why having open access to them is so important in today's society.  Some familiarity with Python will be helpful when it comes to understanding the code snippets, but feel free to skip over those sections if you're not feeling it.  \n",

        "This story begins back in 2014 when Google did a collabaration with Marvel to release the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack for free on Google Play Music. Total marketing campaign success. It got me using the app more frequently, and the more I used it, the more I loved it! Before long I was buying an album a month and it seemed totally reasonable to pay for a subcription to the service.   \n",
        "\n",
        "The performance of the Play Music app was top notch. I especially appreciated the option for caching songs while on WiFi so I could listen to my favorites without eating through my cell phone's data plan.  It also gave me the ability to upload some of the more obscure albums in my collection and easily integrate them into playlists with subscription content.  As I started liking songs on the platform, the algorithm started to get really good at providing me with new music that I actually liked.  Furthermore, the integration with Google's voice activated assistant was perfect for controlling my music mix while driving.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, Google terminated the Play Music service in 2020 and replaced it with YouTube Music.  They migrated over my library well and my Play Music subscription had been upgraded to suppress ads on YouTube, but as a music service it wasn't really meeting my needs.  Songs started cutting out when my phone changed networks.  The voice commands I relied on while driving stopped working.  I'm also pretty sure the web app had a memory leak which would cause it to crash if I listened to a single station for too long.  Everything that I loved about \"Play Music\" gradually slipped away.\n",
        "\n",
        "The nail in the coffin came in 2022 when Google started rolling out content filters on YouTube that flagged videos for depictions of \"self-harm\".  I can understand that this is a good idea in theory, but it essentially made YouTube Music inoperable for me because there was no way to bypass this warning within the YouTube Music app. Rage Against the Machine's entire debut album became inaccessible on the platform overnight -- presumably because of the cover art's depiction of self-immolation. What was most frustrating was that this ban was predominantly affecting playlists I had explicitly made to cope with the grief of having lost close family members to suicide. When you've relied on certain playlists of music to help you process painful emotions for years, having that safety net abruptly taken away from you by a third-party vendor feels pretty fuckin' horrible. And then they had the balls to try to raise the price of their shitty service too? I felt so betrayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "I don't think Google understood the role music really played in my life.  They knew the music was a commodity that I was willing to pay for, but they didn't know the extent to which music was the cornerstone of my emotional foundation. Heck, I don't think I understood it fully either. Other people talk about feeling as originating from the heart, but I've started to wonder if I'm different. I feel like my feelings are closely tied to the physical sensations I associate with music. It's in my fingers when I feel the vibration of the strings against my fingers as I press down up on the frets. I feel it in my lungs when I try to belt out that falsetto. I can feel it resonate through my whole body when I stand to close to the bass amp. Music is more than just a background soundtrack in my life; the rock opera is a mirror to my soul.\n",
        "\n",
        "For better or worse, Google had forced me into paying closer attention to how much of my music library was connected to suicidal themes. It was disturbing see some corners of my music collection getting banned while also seeing obvious references go unnoticed by the algorithm. The lyrics to \"Pardon Me\" by Incubus describe the same event as shown in Rage Against the Machine's album cover but somehow wasn't affected by the filter. Who gives a damn what the album cover looks like if I'm listening to it in my car? Trying to protect me from unanticipated self-harm related imagery in music is a impossible task when I grew up listening to artists like Kurt Cobain, Chris Cornell, and Chester Bennington. The line between the music that heals and the music that hurts is one that that only I can draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with migrating to a new music service lies in training it to understand which music I want and what I don't. Over the 8 years I used Google's music services I had accumulated over 2200 \"likes\" and built dozens of playlists. This music profile has an emotional value that made it difficult to leave the platform.  Cory Doctorow recently wrote about the \"enshittification\" of social media platforms, and I couldn't help but feel that's essentially what happened to Play Music. I was locked in by my data and needed a way out.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Having made a decision to leave, signed up for Spotify and found a service called TuneMyMusic that imported some of my key playlists.  However, there was a 500 song limit on what they'd transfer for free and the playlists I did import weren't as accurate as a would have liked. There was also the problem of it playing a lot of music that I didn't like on radio because my library of favorites was still empty. Hearing Creed in my alt rock radio is enough to make me want to break shit. That's when I decided I would use the Spotify API to just move my Youtube Music \"likes\" over myself.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's something empowering about being able to do this. The continual enshittification of Twitter serves as a constant reminder of the powerful impact of API access. Despite all its flaws, Google had graciously provided me with all the tools I'd need to exit it's own platform -- provided I was willing to put in some effort. I respect that and it's comforting to know I can always reverse this process later if I so choose. \n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, this is probably not something the \"average person\" would be able to do on their own. But I think they could do it with assistance! I wrote this code primarily for myself, but hopefully this will provide a detailed enough example for others to build on.\n",
        "\n",
        "I don't think of APIs as a difficult concept to understand.  They're basically just a computer's version of a contract for certain services. The difficulty lies mostly in knowing of their existence in the first place. You have to know who provides the service and what they allow you to do with it.  Without some idea of what's possible using an API, you'd have no idea what you could use them for! "
